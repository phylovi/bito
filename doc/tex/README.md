Implementation notes.

## Compilation

You need a tex distribution.
Type `scons --sconstruct SConstruct-noinkscape` in the command line if you don't have Inkscape all set up to work on the command line.
If you do, `scons` should work.
Use `scons continuous` to have continuous building after installing inotify.
